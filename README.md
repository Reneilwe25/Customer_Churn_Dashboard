# Telecom Customer Churn Dashboard

## Project overview

This Power BI project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company. The dashboard uncovers patterns in service usage, billing behavior, and customer demographics to identify key churn drivers and suggest retention strategies. The dataset used for this analysis is a sample, utilized for the purpose of practicing report creation and understanding the various aspects of data analysis using PowerBI.

## Project objectives

1. Compare churn rates by gender, senior citizen status, partner, and dependents.
2. Explore how services like Internet type, contract duration, and tech support relate to churn.
3. Investigate whether monthly charges, paperless billing, or payment methods impact churn risk.

## Key Visuals

- **Bar Chart**: Gender vs Churn
- **Pie & Donut Charts**: Partner, PaymentMethod vs Churn
- **Matrix Table**: Phone Service + Multiple Lines vs Churn
- **Stacked Columns**: Contract, Internet Service vs Churn
- **Decomposition Tree**: Top churn contributors
- **KPI Cards**: Total Customers, Churn Rate

## Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query** (data cleanup & type conversion)
- **DAX** (custom measures like Churn Rate)

## Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts and electronic checks have high churn risk.
- Those lacking tech support or online security services are more likely to leave.
- Senior citizens and customers without partners churn slightly more often.

## Recommendations

- Promote yearly or two-year contracts through discounts.
- Offer support service bundles (tech support, device protection).
- Encourage auto-payments via credit card or bank transfer.
